# Detecting-Corona-Virus-from-Persons-X-Ray-Image-with-Deep-Learning
This repo contains the jupyter-notebook for automatically detecting corona virus from person's X-ray image.
The datset used in this notebook was created by Dr Joseph Cohen. Its a open source dataset you can download the using this link (https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset)

<b>Disclaimer:<b> This repo is only for learning purpose, and it may or may not predict corona virus correctly because the model is not that much robust as the data is not sufficient or the availability of data is very less for COVID-19. This model only trained on X-ray images, to create this model robust we need more data like person's health history, population density, geolocation, etc.
